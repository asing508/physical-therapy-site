            <p>
              A physical therapy consultation is a comprehensive one-on-one evaluation with a licensed physical therapist. It's a detailed diagnostic session that goes far beyond a simple chat about your aches. It involves a thorough interview about your health history and a physical assessment to pinpoint the underlying sources of your discomfort or functional limitations. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This initial meeting is foundational; it sets the stage for a successful rehabilitation journey by ensuring your treatment plan is built on a precise understanding of your unique body, lifestyle, and goals. It's about identifying the root cause, not just treating the symptoms.

            <p>Your initial consultation is a structured, collaborative process designed for a thorough assessment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In-Depth Medical History Review:</strong> This is a detailed conversation about your symptoms, when they started, what makes them better or worse, and your overall health history. This context is vital for an accurate diagnosis.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Physical Examination:</strong> Your therapist will perform a series of tests to evaluate your posture, strength, joint mobility, flexibility, and balance. This may include functional movement screens (like observing you walk or squat) and hands-on assessments to identify specific tissues involved.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative Goal Setting:</strong> You'll discuss what you want to achieveâ€”whether it's running a marathon, playing with your grandchildren without pain, or simply getting through a workday comfortably. Your goals are the ultimate benchmark for success.</li>
                <li><strong>Treatment Plan Introduction:</strong> Based on the findings, your therapist will explain their diagnosis in clear terms and outline a proposed treatment plan. You'll understand the recommended therapies, the expected timeline, and what you can do at home to accelerate your progress.</li>

              Cookie-cutter approaches don't work for complex human bodies. A plan tailored specifically to your condition, lifestyle, and goals ensures a more effective and efficient recovery.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Targeted & Efficient Treatment:</strong> A personalized plan focuses on the specific impairments found during your evaluation, ensuring every exercise is purposeful. This leads to faster, more efficient results compared to generic protocols.</li>
              <li><strong>Empowerment Through Education:</strong> A key benefit is understanding the 'why' behind your pain and the 'how' of your recovery. We empower you with knowledge about your body, proper mechanics, and self-management strategies to prevent future recurrences.</li>
              <li><strong>Holistic and Integrated Approach:</strong> Your plan considers your entire lifestyle, including work demands, hobbies, and overall fitness. This ensures the rehabilitation process fits seamlessly into your life, promoting better adherence and long-term success.</li>

              Physical therapy is a partnership. While your therapist provides the expert guidance, your active participation is the most critical ingredient for a successful outcome. Your commitment to the recovery process can significantly accelerate your healing and help you achieve lasting results.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Consistency is Key:</strong> Adhering to your home exercise program is non-negotiable. These exercises are designed to build on the progress made during your sessions and are essential for rebuilding strength and mobility.</li>
              <li><strong>Open Communication:</strong> Always provide honest feedback. Let your therapist know what's working, what's painful, and any challenges you're facing. This allows for real-time adjustments to your treatment plan.</li>
              <li><strong>Patience and Persistence:</strong> Healing takes time. Trust the process, celebrate small victories, and stay focused on your long-term goals. Your dedication is your greatest asset.</li>
